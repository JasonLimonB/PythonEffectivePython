### My Notes

Python is a language multiparadigm and i can use it for OOP like Java

Now we can use the following link for check some recommendation:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/


The next recomendation are:
    1.- Use spaces instead of tabs for identation
    2.- Use 4 spaces for each level of syntactically significant identing
    3.- Lineas should be 79 characters in length or less
    4.- Continuations of long expressions into additional lines should be indented by four extra spaces from their normal indentation level
    5.- In a dictionary, put no white space between each key and colon, and put a single space before the corresponding value if it fits on the same line
    6.- Put one-and only one-space before and after the = operator in a variable assignment

Naming in python3 (PEP 8)
    1._ Functions, variables and attributes should be in lowercase_underscore format
    2.- Protected instance attributes should be in _leading_undeserscore format
    3.- Private instance attributes should be in __double_leading_underscore format
    4.- Classes (including exceptions) should be in CapitalizaedWord format
    5.- Module-level constatns should be in ALL_CAPS format
    6.- Instance mnethods in classes should use slef, wich refers to the object, as the name of the first parameter
    7.- Class methods should use cls, which refers tl the class, as the name of the paramter
